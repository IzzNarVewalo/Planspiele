# Planspiele

- Function names in PascalCase
- Constants in ALL_CAPS
- Private variables in _camelCaseWithUnderscore
- Public properties as getters / setters in PascalCase
- All public variable access should happen through getters / setters
- Regions shouldn't be used, instead split code into classes/files when needed
- Dictionaries preferred over switches and long if/else statements
- Boolean variable names should be prefixed with a question (is/can/should)
- Conditional operator should be avoided. condition ? option1 : option2
- This is fine to use in some niche cases where you can't avoid using it
- Interpolated strings with embedded logic should not be used
